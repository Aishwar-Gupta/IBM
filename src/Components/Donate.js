            Food donations are a great way to help alleviate hunger and increase food security! Food insecurity 
            is characterized by lacking the necessary financial resources to access nutritious food essential 
            for health. Hunger relief organizations form partnerships with individual donors, community retailers, 
            distributors, government agencies, and other organizations to distribute food to food insecure 
            families. With that said, how does donating food help the community? Donating food is a great way to 
            decrease food waste, reduce production of greenhouse gases, and strengthen your community through food.
